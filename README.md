# Wickra Darwin — Go

---

**Part of the [Wickra ecosystem](#ecosystem): — for Go. `go get github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-darwin-go` — over the C ABI via cgo, prebuilt library bundled in the module.**

Go bindings for the Wickra evolutionary strategy search over its C ABI hub via
cgo. A `Darwin` is built from a spec JSON and driven over a JSON boundary, so the
result is byte-identical to every other Wickra Darwin binding.

## Install

Use the published **`wickra-darwin-go`** module, which bundles the prebuilt C ABI
library for every platform, so `go get` + `go build` works with no extra steps
(a C compiler is still required, as the binding uses cgo):

```bash
go get github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-darwin-go
```

`wickra-darwin-go` is generated from this directory by the release pipeline: it mirrors
the Go sources, the vendored C ABI header (`include/wickra_darwin.h`) and the prebuilt
libraries under `lib/<goos>_<goarch>/`. On Linux/macOS the library path is baked
in via rpath; on Windows the DLL must be discoverable at run time (next to the
executable or on `PATH`).

The prebuilt C ABI library is staged per platform under `lib/<goos>_<goarch>/`
and the header is vendored under `include/`. For a local build, copy the library
built by `cargo build -p wickra-darwin-c --release` into the matching
`lib/<goos>_<goarch>/` directory (on Windows, ensure that directory is on `PATH`
when running tests).

### Building from this repository (contributors)

This `bindings/go` directory is the development source. To build it directly,
compile the C ABI and stage the library into the per-platform directory cgo
links against:

```bash
cargo build -p wickra-darwin-c --release
mkdir -p bindings/go/lib/linux_amd64
cp target/release/libwickra_darwin.so bindings/go/lib/linux_amd64/
```

Then, with the library on the loader path, run `go test ./...` from this directory.

## Quick start

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	wickra "github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-darwin-go"
)

func main() {
	spec := `{"seed":1,"population":8,"generations":3,` +
		`"mutation_rate":0.2,"crossover_rate":0.6,"fitness":"sharpe",` +
		`"search_space":{"indicators":[{"name":"rsi","param_ranges":[{"min":2,"max":30,"step":1}]}],` +
		`"rules":"single_threshold","max_conditions":1},"elitism":1,"top":5}`

	darwin, err := wickra.New(spec)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer darwin.Close()

	data := `{"BTCUSDT":[{"time":1700000000,"open":100,"high":101,"low":99,"close":100.5,"volume":10}]}`
	resp, err := darwin.Command(`{"cmd":"evolve","data":` + data + `}`)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(resp)
}
```

### Surface

- **`New(specJSON)`** — build a search handle (`"{}"` defers to a later
  `set_spec`). Returns an error on an invalid spec.
- **`(*Darwin).Command(cmdJSON)`** — apply a command envelope
  (`{"cmd":"...", ...}`) and return the response JSON. Commands: `set_spec`,
  `evolve`, `best`, `version`.
- **`(*Darwin).Close()`** — free the handle (a finalizer also frees it).
- **`Version()`** — the library version.

### Determinism

The search's PRNG lives only in the Rust core; this binding forwards the command
string verbatim, so a given seed produces the byte-identical report here and in
every other binding — the exact cross-language golden invariant.

## Benchmark

Every binding forwards to the same data-driven Rust core, so what this one adds is
the call overhead of cgo over the C ABI, not a different result. The core's throughput is
measured by the repository's benchmark suite and the nightly `bench.yml` run; the
numbers, the machine and how to reproduce them are in the repository
[BENCHMARKS.md](https://github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-darwin/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md).

## Documentation

The full guide, the spec reference and the API documentation live in the main
repository and the documentation site:

- **Repository:** <https://github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-darwin>
- **Docs** (guides, spec reference, cookbook): <https://darwin.wickra.org>
- **Runnable example:** [`examples/go/`](https://github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-darwin/tree/main/examples/go)

- The main project: <https://github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-darwin>
- Documentation: <https://wickra.org>

Wickra Darwin ships native bindings for Python, Node.js, WASM and Rust, plus a C ABI hub that any
C-capable language (C, C++, C#, Go, Java, R) links against — all forwarding to the
same data-driven, `unsafe`-forbidden Rust core.

## Security

Found a security issue? **Please don't open a public issue.** Report it privately
via the repository's *Security* tab (*"Report a vulnerability"*) or email
**support@wickra.org** with a subject line starting `[wickra security]`. Full
policy: <https://github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-darwin/blob/main/SECURITY.md>.

## Disclaimer

Wickra Darwin is a research tool, provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.
Evolutionary search optimises a fitness objective over historical data — a strong
in-sample fitness is not evidence of out-of-sample performance, and overfitting is
the default outcome, not the exception. Nothing here is financial advice; any
strategy you deploy is your responsibility, and trading carries risk of loss.
